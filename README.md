openease/js
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/navidJadid/openease_js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/navidJadid/openease_js)

Repository which contains the javascript code for the openEASE project.

Cannot be run by itself as of right now. Either build the [whole project](https://github.com/ease-crc/openease) with docker-compose (will pull the most recent docker-build from [`docker-hub`](https://hub.docker.com/r/openease/js)) or check out the [development project](https://github.com/navidJadid/openease_webserver_development).

Apart from that, tests will of course still run in CI-environment.
